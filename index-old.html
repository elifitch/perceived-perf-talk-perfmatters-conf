						<p>Any human observable phenomena needs to have a certain level of difference in order for that difference to be noticieable.</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Steve Seow of microsoft found that the JND threshold for time is about 20%.</p>

						<p>It's funny, because the event listener we most frequently use to trigger actions doesn't fire when the user signals intent.</p>
						<p>We use click events, which fire on mouse up, but the user shows you they want to click when they press their mouse down.</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>One of my favorite ways to do that is replacing click events with mousedown (and touchstart) events.</p>
						<p>Click events actually fire not when the mouse button goes down, but when it comes back up again.</p>
						<p>So there's this gap when the user has clicked down, but the click event has yet to fire.</p>
						<p>We can load things when the mouse button goes down, and only display them when the click event fires as the user releases their mouse button.</p>

						<p>People subconsciously hold their mouse button down longer if there is an active animation</p>
						<p>If you set the active animation duration to 150-200ms, people will keep their mouse button pressed for the full duration of the animation; so instead of holding their mouse button down for 100-150ms, they hold it down for 150-200ms.

						<p>Most of the time this is fairly adequate, especially for short durations like loading an image.</p>

							<li>So what's going on here is we record the time that an api request starts, and then on the response we use performance.now to take another high resulotion timestamp. We then save it, setting a performance scalar that is the observed time divided by the expected time.  So if we expected this request to be 1 second, and it took only half a second, the performance scalar for the next progress bar would be 0.5, making the animation duration go twice as fast.  We can use that to modulate progress bar durations and all sorts of other stuff.</li>

							<li>You can normalize this with the size of a postbody as well if you need to.</li>

						<p>Predictive CTA button demo:</p>
						<p>It's a common pattern for big CTA buttons to be obvious and surrounded by white space to attract users to click them.  We predict that if a user hovers the button, they will click the button.  Moreover, if they hover over a hitbox outside the button, we predict they will continue to move their mouse onto the button and click it.  You can reveal the hitbox by clicking the checkbox within the demo.</p>
						<p>In my testing I was able to accomplish about 30% of the loading process before users even clicked the big button.</p>

					<h2>Perceived perf is<br>low hanging fruit.</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>If you have sufficient low hanging fruit to effect a 30% speedup in your app then by all means, do it.  But many team don't have that luxury, and for them it makes a great deal of sense to focus on subjective performance measures before dedicating significant resources on physically making their product faster.</p>

						Made a joke about machine learning and stuff, and while it doesn't have to be that complex it certainly can be.
						If you work for a company that has a lot of data on how your users interact w/ your app, you could very feasibly make accurate predictions about what their next action/page/whatever will be without relying on something so crude as cursor position.
